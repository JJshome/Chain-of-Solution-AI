Extracted from the provided document "통합 문제해결 방법론을 활용한 인공지능 시스템 및 그 방법 {Artificial Intelligence System and Method Utilizing Integrated Problem-Solving Methodologies}"

## I. Key Differences: CoS vs. CoT
(Based on section: "* 본 발명에서 제안된 방식과 Chain of Thought(CoT) 방식 간의 중요한 차이점")

1.  **Problem-Solving Approach:**
    *   **CoT:** Focuses on the reasoning process, prompting the model to clearly show step-by-step inference to derive an answer. Emphasizes a systematic inference path.
    *   **CoS (본 발명):** Goes beyond CoT's step-by-step reasoning by integrating diverse problem-solving methodologies (TRIZ, Mind Maps, Design Thinking, etc.) for a multi-faceted analysis. It's not just about solving step-by-step but providing multiple solutions through a convergent approach, dynamically reconfiguring tools and methodologies.

2.  **Integration of Problem-Solving Methodologies:**
    *   **CoT:** Primarily relies on the AI's inference capabilities, breaking down problems into logical steps.
    *   **CoS (본 발명):** Core to CoS is the integration of various methodologies (TRIZ, Mind Maps, Design Thinking, Systems Thinking). It selects the optimal methodology based on the problem's characteristics, offering flexibility and scalability across domains. This integration is a key differentiator.

3.  **Utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs):**
    *   **CoT:** Uses LLM's natural language inference capabilities to understand the problem and derive answers in stages.
    *   **CoS (본 발명):** Combines LLMs with diverse problem-solving methodologies. It doesn't just aid reasoning but integrates multi-domain knowledge, dynamic reconfiguration, and feedback loops to solve problems more effectively. This includes using TRIZ60 principles and expanded Su-Field analysis for complex technical and system interaction problems.

4.  **Continuous Learning and Feedback Loops:**
    *   **CoT:** Primarily follows a single problem-solving flow, focusing on clear reasoning steps. Continuous learning or real-time feedback isn't a core CoT element.
    *   **CoS (본 발명):** Features an AI feedback loop for continuous system performance improvement and real-time optimization. The system can dynamically adapt to problem situations and reconfigure itself, immediately responding to changing environments or complex issues.

5.  **Optimization and Domain Specialization:**
    *   **CoT:** Focuses on enhancing reasoning capabilities step-by-step, less on domain specialization.
    *   **CoS (본 발명):** Provides custom optimization for specific domains using LoRA-based fine-tuning (and other fine-tuning methods), delivering high-performance AI solutions for various industrial or technical problems. Designed to achieve high performance even with limited resources.

**Conclusion from the document:** "CoT is a method focused on solving problems step-by-step, whereas the present invention (CoS) is a system that integrates various problem-solving methodologies and combines them with large-scale language models to more effectively solve complex problems. The present invention dynamically adapts to problem situations, continuously optimizes through real-time feedback, and provides a universal and powerful solution applicable across various domains. Therefore, it can be called Chain of Solution."
