# Chain of Solution Architecture

## Overview

The Chain of Solution (CoS) framework consists of several interconnected components that work together to enable cross-modal pattern detection and problem-solving. This document outlines the architecture of the CoS framework and how its components interact.

## Core Components

### 1. Multimodal Feature Extraction

This component is responsible for extracting features from different data modalities (text, images, sound, etc.). It employs specialized techniques for each modality:

- **Text Feature Extraction**: Natural language processing techniques to extract semantic and contextual features
- **Image Feature Extraction**: Computer vision algorithms to extract visual features
- **Sound Feature Extraction**: Audio processing algorithms to extract acoustic features

### 2. Cross-Modal Integration Layer

The Cross-Modal Integration Layer is a critical component that identifies patterns and relationships across different modalities. It employs:

- **Cross-Attention Mechanisms**: To correlate features across modalities
- **Multimodal Fusion Techniques**: To combine information from different sources
- **Relation Networks**: To model the interaction between features from different modalities

### 3. TRIZ Problem-Solving Engine

This component implements the expanded TRIZ60 methodology for structured problem-solving. It includes:

- **Contradiction Analysis**: Identifies and resolves technical and physical contradictions
- **Su-Field Analysis**: Analyzes substance-field interactions for system improvement
- **Ideality Assessment**: Evaluates solutions based on their ideality

### 4. Large Language Model Integration

The CoS framework integrates with Large Language Models to enhance reasoning capabilities:

- **Prompt Engineering**: Specialized prompts that guide LLMs through the CoS framework
- **Reasoning Augmentation**: Enhances LLM reasoning with TRIZ principles
- **Output Refinement**: Structures LLM outputs according to CoS methodology

## Data Flow

1. Raw multimodal data is fed into the framework
2. Feature extraction components process each modality separately
3. Cross-Modal Integration Layer identifies patterns across modalities
4. TRIZ Problem-Solving Engine analyzes these patterns for contradictions and potential solutions
5. LLM Integration provides natural language reasoning and communication

## Implementation

The CoS framework is implemented as a modular system, with each component exposing a standardized API. This allows for flexibility in deployment and customization for specific applications.

### Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core implementation language
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow**: Deep learning components
- **FastAPI**: API services
- **Docker/Kubernetes**: Containerization and orchestration

## Scalability

The architecture is designed to scale horizontally, with stateless components that can be replicated to handle increased load. Data processing is optimized for distributed computing environments.
