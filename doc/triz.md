# TRIZ Methodology in Chain of Solution

## Introduction to TRIZ

TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) is a structured problem-solving methodology developed by Genrich Altshuller. It is based on the analysis of patents and technical innovations, identifying patterns and principles that can be applied to solve technical contradictions and develop innovative solutions.

The Chain of Solution framework extends TRIZ with additional principles, multimodal data analysis, and integration with modern AI techniques.

## TRIZ60: Extended TRIZ Principles

The traditional TRIZ methodology includes 40 inventive principles. The CoS framework extends this to 60 principles (TRIZ60) to address modern technological challenges. The additional 20 principles include:

41. Adjustment
42. Dynamic Reconfiguration
43. Energy Redistribution
44. Multi-state Operation
45. Non-linear Interactions
46. Self-diagnosis
47. Information Compression
48. Resource Recycling
49. Scalability
50. Boundary Condition Optimization
51. Interoperability
52. Emotion Recognition
53. Stochastic Optimization
54. Energy Field Manipulation
55. Wave Control
56. Time Management
57. Flexibility
58. Molecular Level Control
59. Feedback Loop Enhancement
60. Variable Connectivity

## Contradiction Matrix

The Contradiction Matrix is a tool used in TRIZ to identify which principles are most effective for resolving specific technical contradictions. The CoS framework includes an expanded contradiction matrix that incorporates the additional principles and covers a broader range of modern technical challenges.

## Su-Field Analysis

Substance-Field (Su-Field) Analysis is a TRIZ tool used to model problems in terms of substances (objects) and fields (interactions). The CoS framework extends Su-Field analysis to 100 standard solutions, allowing for more complex system modeling and solution generation.

The expanded Su-Field analysis includes modern concepts such as:

- Quantum effects
- Nano-scale interactions
- Biological and biochemical fields
- Information fields
- Social and psychological interactions

## Integration with AI

The CoS framework integrates TRIZ60 principles with artificial intelligence in multiple ways:

1. **Automated Contradiction Detection**: AI analyzes multimodal data to automatically identify technical and physical contradictions.

2. **Principle Selection**: Machine learning models recommend the most appropriate TRIZ principles based on historical success patterns.

3. **Solution Generation**: Generative AI creates potential solutions based on the selected principles and system constraints.

4. **Solution Evaluation**: AI evaluates the ideality and feasibility of generated solutions.

## TRIZ in Cross-Modal Analysis

A unique aspect of the CoS framework is the application of TRIZ principles to cross-modal data analysis:

- **Contradictions Between Modalities**: Identifying when different data modalities suggest conflicting patterns or solutions

- **Field Interactions Across Modalities**: Analyzing how fields (interactions) in one modality affect substances (objects) in another

- **Ideality Across Modalities**: Optimizing solutions that balance benefits across different data types and domains

This cross-modal application of TRIZ enables the CoS framework to solve complex problems that traditional single-modality approaches cannot address.
