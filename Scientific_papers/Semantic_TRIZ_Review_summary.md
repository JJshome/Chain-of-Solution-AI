## Summary

This paper presents a systematic review of the applications and limitations of traditional TRIZ methodologies in modern technology development. The authors analyze how TRIZ principles can be enhanced through semantic approaches and machine learning to better address contemporary innovation challenges.

## Key Points

- **TRIZ Limitations**: The review identifies several limitations in traditional TRIZ approaches, including a rigid knowledge base, limited user adaptability, and challenges in applying TRIZ to emerging technology domains.

- **Semantic Extensions**: The authors propose semantic enhancements to TRIZ that could make it more adaptable to modern technological challenges, including AI-assisted problem formulation and solution generation.

- **Integration Possibilities**: The paper explores how TRIZ could be integrated with other methodologies like Design Thinking and Agile Development to create more comprehensive innovation frameworks.

- **Future Directions**: The authors suggest that future TRIZ developments should focus on creating more dynamic knowledge bases and incorporating real-time data analysis capabilities.

## Relevance to Chain of Solution Framework

This systematic review provides important context for our Chain of Solution (CoS) framework by highlighting the limitations that CoS specifically addresses:

1. **Fixed vs. Dynamic Knowledge**: The paper criticizes TRIZ's fixed knowledge base, which CoS addresses through its AI feedback loop and dynamic reconfiguration capabilities.

2. **User Adaptation**: The review notes TRIZ's limitations in adapting to user needs, which CoS overcomes through its interactive parameters and user feedback integration.

3. **Emerging Technology Applications**: The authors highlight difficulty in applying TRIZ to emerging domains, while CoS is specifically designed for modern technological challenges like quantum computing, nanotechnology, and bioinformatics.

4. **Methodological Integration**: While the paper suggests theoretical integration of TRIZ with other methodologies, CoS actually implements this integration through its multi-methodology approach combining TRIZ, Su-Field analysis, design thinking, and more.

5. **Real-time Adaptation**: The review suggests future TRIZ systems should incorporate real-time data analysis, which is a core feature of the CoS framework through its multimodal analysis engine.

The limitations and suggestions in this review paper directly informed many of the design decisions in the Chain of Solution framework, making it a valuable reference for understanding the evolution from traditional TRIZ to our advanced CoS approach.
