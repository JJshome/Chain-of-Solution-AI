## Chain of Solution Framework

The Chain of Solution framework represents a significant advancement beyond traditional TRIZ approaches by:
- Incorporating TRIZ60 (60 principles vs traditional 40)
- Extending Su-Field analysis to 100 standard solutions
- Integrating multiple problem-solving methodologies (TRIZ, Mind Mapping, Design Thinking, System Thinking)
- Implementing dynamic reconfiguration and AI feedback loops
- Supporting real-time optimization and self-diagnosis capabilities
