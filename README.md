# Chain of Solution (CoS) Framework

## Overview

Chain of Solution (CoS) is a novel framework that transcends traditional problem-solving methodologies by detecting patterns that emerge specifically from cross-modal data interactions. It integrates structured TRIZ problem-solving methodology with multimodal data analysis to identify critical patterns that emerge only from interactions between different data types.

This project implements the Chain of Solution framework as described in the paper:
"Chain of Solution Framework: Could We Have Prevented Romeo and Juliet's Tragedy?"
by Jee Hwan Jang, Sungkyunkwan University & Ucaretron Inc.

## Key Concepts

Unlike Chain of Thought approaches that follow sequential reasoning, CoS organizes problems across different scales through innovative feature engineering that captures relationships between modalities (text, sound, images). This structured approach enables systematic identification of contradictions and their resolution through principled methods rather than unstructured reasoning.

The framework is built on these key components:

1. **TRIZ60 Principles**: An expanded set of 60 problem-solving principles based on the traditional 40 TRIZ principles, with 20 additional principles that address modern technological challenges
2. **Su-Field Analysis**: A method for analyzing and modeling the interactions between substances and fields in a system
3. **Multimodal Data Analysis**: Techniques for analyzing data from different modalities (text, images, audio, time series) to identify emergent patterns
4. **Large Language Model Integration**: Utilization of large language models for natural language understanding and generation

## Example Applications

The framework has been implemented in three key areas:

1. **Digital Pathology (CellStyle™)**: Integrates microscopic and clinical data to reveal multi-scale disease patterns
2. **Sound Analysis (SoundPose™)**: Structures acoustic features to identify health conditions
3. **Image Enhancement**: Uses feature interactions for contextual reconstruction

When applied to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, the approach demonstrated 25% greater prediction accuracy compared to existing methods and enabled discovery of novel inter-modality markers undetectable through conventional single-modality analyses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JJshome/Chain-of-Solution-AI.git
cd Chain-of-Solution-AI

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from src import ChainOfSolution

# Initialize Chain of Solution framework
config = {
    'model_type': 'llama3.1',
    'model_size': '8B',
    'use_emergent_pattern_detection': True,
    'use_triz60': True,
    'use_su_field_analysis': True,
    'max_recommendations': 5
}
cos = ChainOfSolution(config)

# Define a problem
problem = "Design a non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring system for diabetes patients"

# Solve the problem
solution = cos.solve_problem(problem)

# Print solution summary
print(solution['summary'])
print(f"Confidence: {solution['confidence']:.2f}")
print(f"Number of recommendations: {len(solution['recommendations'])}")
```

## Simulation Environment

The project includes a simulation environment for testing the Chain of Solution framework:

```python
from deployment.simulation import CoSSimulation

# Create simulation environment
sim = CoSSimulation()

# Run a simulation
results = sim.run_simulation(
    domain='healthcare',
    complexity=0.7,
    noise_level=0.3,
    iterations=3
)

# Visualize results
sim.visualize_results(results)
```

## Future Development

The ultimate goal is to implement this Chain of Solution framework within Large Language Models (LLMs), creating CoS-LLM systems capable of identifying emergent patterns across modalities, detecting subtle interaction signals, and solving complex problems by analyzing relationships that exist between different types of data rather than analyzing the data in isolation.
