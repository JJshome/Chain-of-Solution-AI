The Chain of Solution AI System is designed to address complex problems by systematically guiding users through a structured problem-solving process. Its main goal is to enhance innovation and solution generation by integrating established methodologies with artificial intelligence capabilities. The system aims to provide a comprehensive framework that helps users define problems clearly, explore a wide range of potential solutions, and ultimately select the most effective path forward.

This system uniquely combines traditional problem-solving methodologies, such as TRIZ and Su-Field analysis, with advanced AI techniques. Notably, it incorporates specific extensions like TRIZ60 and Su-Field 100, offering a more granular and powerful approach to inventive problem-solving and system analysis, thereby setting it apart from conventional AI tools by providing a deeply integrated and method-driven solution pathway.
