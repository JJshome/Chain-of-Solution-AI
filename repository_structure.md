# Repository Structure for Chain of Solution AI System

This document outlines the main directories within the Chain of Solution AI System repository and their purposes.

1.  **Root Directory (`/`)**
    *   **Purpose:** The root directory serves as the main entry point for the project.
    *   **Typical Contents:** It contains the primary `README.md` which provides a comprehensive overview of the Chain of Solution (CoS) AI System, including its features, architecture, installation instructions, quick start guide, core components, and links to further documentation and resources. It also hosts key project files like `requirements.txt` (listing dependencies) and `setup.py` (for packaging and distribution). Files generated by the agent like `chain_of_solution_overview.md` and `key_technologies.md` are also present here.

2.  **`src/` (Source Code)**
    *   **Purpose:** This directory houses the core implementation of the Chain of Solution (CoS) framework.
    *   **Typical Contents:** As per its `README.md`, it is structured into subdirectories:
        *   `core/`: Contains the fundamental components of the CoS framework.
        *   `triz/`: Includes the implementation of TRIZ principles, notably the expanded TRIZ60 methodology, and Su-Field analysis.
        *   `multimodal/`: Provides tools for multimodal data analysis.
        *   `models/`: Contains components related to Large Language Model (LLM) integration (e.g., Llama3.1).
        *   `applications/`: Showcases example applications of the CoS framework in specific domains like digital pathology and sound analysis.
        *   `resources/`: Contains knowledge files like JSONs for TRIZ60 principles, Su-Field templates, OS Matrix, etc.

3.  **`doc/` (Documentation)**
    *   **Purpose:** This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the CoS framework.
    *   **Typical Contents:** Based on its `README.md`, it includes:
        *   `architecture.md`: Detailed description of the CoS system architecture.
        *   `triz.md`, `su_field.md`: Specific documentation on the TRIZ methodology and Su-Field analysis as implemented in the system.
        *   `multimodal_analysis.md`: Guides on using the multimodal data analysis capabilities.
        *   `llm_integration.md`: Information on the integration of Large Language Models.
        *   `api_reference.md`: Detailed API documentation for developers.
        *   `images/`: Contains diagrams and images used in the documentation (e.g., system architecture, application areas).
        *   It may also contain tutorials (as mentioned in its README, though not explicitly listed in the `ls` output).

4.  **`examples/`**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides practical examples and scripts to demonstrate how to use the CoS system and its various features.
    *   **Typical Contents:** Python scripts showcasing different use cases, such as `example_cos.py`, and domain-specific examples like electrochemical biosensor design, Six Sigma quality control, technology strategy, and product lifecycle management (as referenced in the root `README.md`). It contains an `__init__.py` file, making it a Python package.

5.  **`deployment/`**
    *   **Purpose:** Contains resources and configurations for deploying the CoS framework in different environments.
    *   **Typical Contents:** According to its `README.md`, this includes:
        *   `docker/`: Dockerfiles and configurations for containerized deployments.
        *   `kubernetes/`: Kubernetes configurations for orchestrated deployments.
        *   `simulation/`: A simulation environment (`cos_simulation.py`) for testing and experimenting with the framework.
        *   Example deployment configurations.

6.  **`Scientific_papers/`**
    *   **Purpose:** This directory stores summaries, references, and potentially full texts of scientific papers relevant to the CoS framework, TRIZ, AI integration, and related fields.
    *   **Typical Contents:** `README.md` listing the papers, and individual markdown files or PDFs summarizing key research (e.g., `AutoTRIZ_paper_summary.md`, `Semantic_TRIZ_Review_summary.md`). It also contains the `Chain_of_Solution_Framework_overview.md`.

7.  **`tests/`**
    *   **Purpose:** Contains all the test scripts for the CoS system, ensuring code quality, correctness, and reliability.
    *   **Typical Contents:** While not explicitly explored via `ls` or `read_files` in this sequence of operations, the root `README.md` mentions running unit tests (`python -m pytest tests/`) and integration tests (`python -m pytest tests/integration/`). This implies subdirectories for different types of tests (e.g., `unit/`, `integration/`) containing Python test files using frameworks like pytest.

8.  **`scientific_papers/` (lowercase)**
    *   **Purpose:** This directory appears to be a less organized or possibly outdated collection relating to scientific papers.
    *   **Typical Contents:** Contains `chain_of_solution_summary.md`. It is distinct from the more structured `Scientific_papers/` (uppercase) directory.
