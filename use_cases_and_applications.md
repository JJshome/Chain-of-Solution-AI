# Use Cases and Application Areas for the Chain of Solution AI System

This document outlines the general application areas and specific examples of problems or domains where the Chain of Solution (CoS) AI System can be applied. This information is derived from the main `README.md` and details about the `src/applications/` directory.

## General Application Areas

The "Multi-Domain Applications" section of the `README.md` highlights the versatility of the CoS framework across various sectors:

1.  **Manufacturing:**
    *   Indicated by the integration with "6시그마 품질관리" (6 Sigma Quality Management), suggesting applications in process improvement, quality control, and operational efficiency.

2.  **Research & Development (R&D):**
    *   Mention of "기술전략" (Technology Strategy), "특허맵" (Patent Map), and "연구개발 Life Cycle" (R&D Life Cycle) points to its use in innovation management, strategic planning for technology development, and managing the lifecycle of research projects.

3.  **Business:**
    *   Applications in "Product Life Cycle" management, "Supply Chain" optimization, "ERP" (Enterprise Resource Planning) contexts, and "마케팅" (Marketing) show its potential for solving complex business problems and strategizing.

4.  **Advanced Technology Sectors:**
    *   The "주요 특징" (Key Features) section of the root `README.md` also mentions applicability in "나노기술, 자율주행, 생명공학, 양자 컴퓨팅 등 첨단 분야" (nanotechnology, autonomous driving, biotechnology, quantum computing, and other advanced fields).

## Specific Examples and Domains

The "Examples" section of the root `README.md` and information from `src/README.md` regarding the `src/applications/` directory provide concrete examples:

1.  **Electrochemical Biosensor Design:**
    *   Referenced in the "Quick Start" (`problem['description']`) and listed as an example (`examples/electrochemical_biosensor.py`). This involves designing sensor components, such as "간섭을 보상하는 두 전극 테스트 스트립" (a two-electrode test strip to compensate for interference).

2.  **6 Sigma Quality Management:**
    *   Listed as an example application (`examples/six_sigma_quality.py`), aligning with the manufacturing application area.

3.  **Technology Strategy Formulation:**
    *   Provided as an example (`examples/technology_strategy.py`), relevant to R&D and strategic business planning.

4.  **Product Lifecycle Management:**
    *   Listed as an example (`examples/product_lifecycle.py`), a key concern in business and manufacturing.

5.  **Digital Pathology (CellStyle™):**
    *   Mentioned in `src/README.md` as an application within `src/applications/digital_pathology.py`. This suggests use in analyzing medical images, possibly for cell classification or disease detection.

6.  **Sound Analysis (SoundPose™):**
    *   Mentioned in `src/README.md` as an application within `src/applications/sound_analysis.py`. This could involve tasks like sound event detection, acoustic scene analysis, or perhaps pose estimation from sound characteristics.

7.  **Image Enhancement (Contextual Reconstruction):**
    *   Mentioned in `src/README.md` as an application within `src/applications/image_enhancement.py`. This points to capabilities in improving image quality, potentially using contextual information for more advanced reconstruction tasks.

These examples demonstrate the CoS system's capability to tackle a wide array of complex problems by integrating systematic problem-solving methodologies with AI across diverse scientific, engineering, and business domains.
